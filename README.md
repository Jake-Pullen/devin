# Devin - Your Personal AI Assistant

Welcome to Devin, your very own Jarvis-inspired AI assistant! This project aims to create a
powerful, extensible AI system that can understand and respond to your questions while gradually
building up capabilities through tools and worker agents.

## Project Overview

Devin is designed to be a personal AI assistant that:
- Connects to local LLMs for natural language understanding and generation
- Responds to user questions in a conversational manner
- Scales from simple question answering to complex multi-agent workflows
- Provides a foundation for building sophisticated AI tools and systems

# üß† Local LLM Assistant with UV

A simple yet powerful local AI assistant that leverages a locally hosted LLM (via LM Studio) and integrates tools such as weather lookup and folder search. Built using Python, with package management handled via [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

## üìå Overview

This project allows you to interact with a local large language model (LLM) through a terminal-based interface. It supports tool integration for tasks like fetching current weather or locating folders on your machine.

### Features
- ‚úÖ Communicates with LM Studio via API
- ‚úÖ Tool support: `get_weather`, `find_folder`
- ‚úÖ Easy-to-use CLI interface
- ‚úÖ Uses UV for fast, modern package management

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) installed and running with a model (e.g., `qwen/qwen3-coder-30b`)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed for package management

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies using UV:

```bash
uv sync
```

> This command will install all project dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

3. Ensure LM Studio is running and the server is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the application using:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Then, you can interact with the LLM by typing prompts directly into the terminal.

### Example Tools

You can use the following tools in your prompts:
- `get_weather`: Get current weather for a location.
  - Example prompt: *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather like in London?‚Äù*
- `find_folder`: Find folders matching a name.
  - Example prompt: *‚ÄúFind the devin folder‚Äù*

## üß™ Development

To add new tools or modify existing ones:
1. Add your function to `tools.py`.
2. Register it in `ToolExecutor` class under `self.tools`.
3. Update the system prompt in `config.py` if needed.
